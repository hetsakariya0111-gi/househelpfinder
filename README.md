# House Help Finder 🏠

## Project Overview

**House Help Finder** is a web-based platform designed to connect households with local domestic workers such as maids, cooks, drivers, babysitters, and cleaners. The platform provides a simple and reliable way for homeowners to find trusted help for daily household tasks, while also creating employment opportunities for workers by allowing them to register and showcase their services.

This project is built using a modern full-stack web development approach with **React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Tailwind CSS**.

# Problem Statement

Finding reliable domestic workers is often challenging. Most households depend on word-of-mouth, local contacts, or neighborhood recommendations. This process is slow, unreliable, and limited to small social circles.

Some common problems include:

* Difficulty finding workers in nearby areas
* Lack of a centralized platform for domestic services
* No proper profile or experience information about workers
* Time-consuming search process for both employers and workers
* Limited job opportunities visibility for domestic workers

Because of these challenges, many households struggle to find suitable help, and many workers struggle to find consistent work.

---

# Proposed Solution

**House Help Finder** solves this problem by providing a centralized online platform where:

* Domestic workers can create profiles and list their services.
* Homeowners can search for workers based on location and service type.
* Users can easily view worker details and contact them.

This platform makes the process faster, more transparent, and accessible for both service providers and households.
